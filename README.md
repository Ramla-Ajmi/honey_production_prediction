Honey Production Prediction using Linear Regression

This project analyzes honey production data in the United States and uses linear regression to predict future production trends. The dataset contains information about honey production over different years, and the model forecasts the production up to the year 2050.

Overview

The project performs the following tasks:

1. Data Loading : Reads honey production data from a CSV file.
2. Data Visualization : Displays the honey production per year using a scatter plot.
3. Linear Regression : Fits a linear regression model to the historical honey production data to make predictions.
4. Future Pr√©dictions : Uses the trained model to predict future honey production (from 2013 to 2050).
5. Plotting : Visualizes the actual data, the linear regression line for past years, and the future predictions on a single graph.

Requirements

You need to have the following Python libraries installed to run this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn"# honey_production_prediction"
